Whatever IDE you use, install and activate this plugins to maintain our consistent coding styles accross contributor with various IDE.

_Note: The configuration already included in this project. check: `.editorconfig`_

### 2. Use Prettier

We use (and you must use this) Prettier to enforces a consistent style based on the rule that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. If you use VSCode as your IDE, use [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension to address this and we already ship the configuration file under `.vscode` directory.
